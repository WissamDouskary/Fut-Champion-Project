#### Fut Champion Project

This application allows users to create and manage a football team formation with dynamic player management. Users can select from predefined tactical formations, manage player positions, and ensure the team setup is correct, all while keeping a user-friendly interface.

Key Features:

1. Dynamic Player Management

Player Form: Users can add players to the team through a dynamic form with necessary fields such as name, position, rating, and statistics.
Position Adaptation: The player positions are automatically adjusted based on the selected formation 4-3-3.

3. Tactical Formation Setup

The application supports two main formations:
4-3-3: Includes 1 Goalkeeper (GK), 2 Center-Backs (CB), 1 Left-Back (LB), 1 Right-Back (RB), 3 Central Midfielders (CM), 1 Left Wing (LW), 1 Right Wing (RW), and 1 Striker (ST).
The positions of players are updated automatically based on the selected formation.
Only valid positions for the selected formation are available for each player.
5. Player Card Management

Users can add, modify, and delete player cards using a simple UI interface.
There is a strict limit of 11 players for the main formation, with additional players reserved for substitutions.
6. Dynamic Player Form for Player Management

Users can dynamically add or remove players while adhering to the formation rules.
The system ensures the formation stays within the limit of 11 players for the main team, with any excess players reserved as substitutes.
7. Form Field Validation

Validation is applied to ensure that all form fields (name, position, rating) are completed accurately and consistently.
